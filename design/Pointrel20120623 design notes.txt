Thinking about removing the layer of variable change objects. 
It mostly duplicates what is in the transactions. 
The variables support rollback.
They also support more generic use of the system (without transactions).
But, in practice, they add an extra level of clutter.
I could add them back in if essential at some point.
For now, when something is backed out, realizing I could add a new transaction that represents that.
So, a new transaction would have a later date and a committer, but no records added or removed.
The new transaction would just have a different transaction that it depends on.
It could maybe have a comment as a rollback.
So, thinking, for transactions, should add support for a comment (like variable changes have now).
And should add support for what workspace the transaction is for.
I had not wanted to put a variable name or workspace into transactions.
But, I'm thinking that maybe it is best.
Perhaps a UUID for a workspace?
So, a workspace is essentially a set of transactions?
Still, not 100% sure.
Was thinking about it this morning.

Updated design document to see how it look. Looks OK.
